Nathon and Melissa



Good afternoon.



I received a signed around purchase and sale addendum regarding the extension for closing (02.23, or sooner).  I wanted to follow up with you regarding the following items requested and updated items needed for final review and approval:

Are you ready to lock your rate in – rates have remained the same (5.500%)

Copies of all paid receipts for any items obtained, such as inspections, water tests, or other independent inspections for the purpose of this home purchase

Lot loan property requirements – if serviced by a septic system, please provide either a satisfactory perc test, approved septic design, or septic permit

Credit – USAA auto refinance

I will be pulling a new credit report and I hope to see your new auto loan showing on the report (your report in the file has expired).  If for some reason, it is not showing, I will request a verification of loan for this credit facility from USAA (new payment of $684.36).

SSA form for Melissa to sign - attached

Assets – 2 months current, consecutive bank statements showing funds to close

Boeing Employees Credit Union

USAA

Income

Paystubs – 3 current, consecutive paystubs

W-2s – 2020

Real estate owned (primary residence)

Current mortgage statement (due date of February)

2021 HOAs document showing new monthly HOA fee


Thanks so much and please let me know if you have any questions and if you are ready to lock your rate in.
